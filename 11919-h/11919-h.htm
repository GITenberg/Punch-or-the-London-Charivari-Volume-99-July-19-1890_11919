        <h3>PARALLEL.</h3>Joe, the Fat Boy in Pickwick, startles
        the Old Lady; Oscar, the Fad Boy in Lippincott's, startles
        Mrs. Grundy.<br />
        <i>Oscar, the Fad Boy</i>. "I want to make your flesh
        creep!"
    </div>

    <p>The Baron has read OSCAR WILDE'S Wildest and Oscarest work,
    called <i>Dorian Gray</i>, a weird sensational romance,
    complete in one number of <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i>. The
    Baron, recommends anybody who revels in <i>diablerie</i>, to
    begin it about half-past ten, and to finish it at one sitting
    up; but those who do not so revel he advises either not to read
    it at all, or to choose the daytime, and take it in
    homoeopathic doses. The portrait represents the soul of the
    beautiful Ganymede-like <i>Dorian Gray</i>, whose youth and
    beauty last to the end, while his soul, like JOHN BROWN'S,
    "goes marching on" into the Wilderness of Sin. It becomes at
    last a devilled soul. And then <i>Dorian</i> sticks a knife
    into it, as any ordinary mortal might do, and a fork also, and
    next morning</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Lifeless but 'hideous' he lay,"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>while the portrait has recovered the perfect beauty which it
    possessed when it first left the artist's easel. If OSCAR
    intended an allegory, the finish is dreadfully wrong. Does he
    mean that, by sacrificing his earthly life, <i>Dorian Gray</i>
    atones for his infernal sins, and so purifies his soul by
    suicide? "Heavens! I am no preacher," says the Baron, "and
    perhaps OSCAR didn't mean anything at all, except to give us a
    sensation, to show how like BULWER LYTTON'S old-world style he
    could make his descriptions and his dialogue, and what an easy
    thing it is to frighten the respectable <i>Mrs. Grundy</i> with
    a Bogie." The style is decidedly Lyttonerary. His aphorisms are
    Wilde, yet forced. Mr. OSCAR WILDE says of his story, "it is
    poisonous if you like, but you cannot deny that it is also
    perfect, and perfection is what we artists aim at." Perhaps;
    but "we artists" do not always hit what we aim at, and, despite
    his confident claim to unerring artistic marksmanship, one must
    hazard the opinion, that in this case Mr. WILDE has "shot
    wide." There is indeed more of "poison" than of "perfection" in
    <i>Dorian Gray</i>. The central idea is an excellent, if not
    exactly novel, one; and a finer art, say that of NATHANIEL
    HAWTHORNE, would have made a striking and satisfying story of
    it. <i>Dorian Gray</i> is striking enough, in a sense, but it
    is not "satisfying" artistically, any more than it is so
    ethically. Mr. WILDE has preferred the sensuous and
    hyperdecorative manner of "Mademoiselle DE MAUPIN," and without
    GAUTIER'S power, has spoilt a promising conception by clumsy
    unideal treatment. His "decoration" (upon which he plumes
    himself) is indeed "laid on with a trowel." The luxuriously
    elaborate details of his "artistic hedonism" are too suggestive
    of South Kensington Museum and &aelig;sthetic
    Encyclop&aelig;dias. A truer art would have avoided both the
    glittering conceits, which bedeck the body of the story, and
    the unsavoury suggestiveness which lurks in its spirit.
    Poisonous! Yes. But the loathly "leperous distilment" taints
    and spoils, without in any way subserving "perfection,"
    artistic or otherwise. If <i>Mrs. Grundy</i> doesn't read it,
    the younger <i>Grundies</i> do; that is, the <i>Grundies</i>
    who belong to Clubs, and who care to shine in certain sets
    wherein this story will be much discussed. "I have read it,
    and, except for the ingenious idea, I wish to forget it," says
    the Baron.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Baron has seen the new, lively, and eccentric newspaper,
    entitled <i>The Whirlwind</i>. It has reached the third number.
    "I am informed," says the Baron, "that, on payment of five
    guineas down, I can become a life-subscriber to the
    <i>Whirlwind</i>. But what does life-subscriber mean? Do I
    subscribe for the term of my life, or for the term of the
    <i>Whirlwind's</i> life? Suppose the <i>Whirlwind</i> has to be
    wound up, or whirl-winded up, and suppose I am still going on,
    can I intervene to stop the proceedings, and insist on my
    contract to be supplied with a <i>Whirlwind</i> per week for
    the remainder of my natural or unnatural life being carried
    out? If the contract is for our lives, then, as a
    life-subscriber, I should insist on the <i>Whirlwind</i>
    remaining co-existent with me, so that, up to my latest breath,
    I might have a <i>Whirlwind</i>. But if the life-subscription
    of five guineas is only for the term of the <i>Whirlwind's</i>
    life, then, I fancy the proprietors, editor, and staff, that
    the Hon. STUART ERSKINE and Mr. HERBERT VIVIAN, who are, I
    believe, the Proprietors, Editor, and Staff of the
    <i>Whirlwind</i>, will have by far the better of the bargain. I
    resist the temptation, and keep my five pounds five shillings
    in my pocket, and am</p>

    <p>URGENT CASE.&mdash;WANTED, by a little Boy, aged 10, of
    thoroughly disagreeable temper, selfish, greedy, ill-mannered,
    and thoroughly spoilt at home, a good sound Whipping, weekly,
    if possible. Great care will be necessary on the part of
    applicant in fulfilling requirements, parents of youth in
    question, being firmly convinced that he is a noble little
    fellow, with a fine manly spirit, just what his dear Papa was
    at his age (as is very probably the case) and only requiring
    peculiarly gentle and considerate treatment.&mdash;Apply (in
    first instance, by letter) to Godfather, care of <i>Mr.
    Punch</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS,&mdash;affectionate but
    practical-minded, and anxious to find economical homes
    (somewhere else) for young gentlemen who cannot get on without
    expensive assistance at starting in Mother country, owing to
    excessive competition in laborious and over-crowded
    professions. A firm of enterprising Agents offer bracing and
    profitable occupation (coupled with the use <i>gratis</i>, of
    two broken spades, an old manure-cart, and an axe without a
    handle) in a peculiarly romantic and unhealthy district in the
    backwoods of West-Torrida. Photograph, if desired, of Agent's
    residence (distant several hundred miles away.) Excellent
    opening for young men fresh from first-class public school or
    college-life: who should, of course, be prepared to "rough it"
    a little before making competence or large fortune, by
    delightful pursuit of agriculture. No restrictive civilisation.
    No drains. Excellent supply of water and heavy floods as a
    rule, during three months of year, bringing on Spring crops
    without expense of irrigation. Very low death-rate, most of
    population having recently cleared out. Small village and
    (horse)-doctor within twenty-five miles' ride. Wild and
    beautiful country. Every incentive to work. Rare poisonous
    reptiles, and tarantula spiders, most interesting to young
    observant naturalist. Capital prospect&mdash;great saving
    offered to careful parents anxious to set up brougham, or
    increase private expenses. Five boys (reduction on taking a
    quantity) disposed of for about &pound;250 and outfit, with
    probably, no further trouble.&mdash;Address, Messrs. SHARKEY

    Twopenny Toff of 'Ighgate 'Ill</i>," and "<i>Tommy Robinson's
    Last Cigar</i>," and also play piano if required, with one
    finger, but prefers to be accompanied by indefatigable friend,
    who plays entirely by ear, and if allowed to smoke freely, can
    "pick up" any tune in a quarter of an hour. Seldom breaks down
    or forgets words, except before large or unsympathetic
    audience. Fetching comic "biz," and superlative Music-hall
    "chic." Would have no objection to black face and appear at
    evening parties, or in fashionable streets, with banjo (if
    provided with small police escort.) Testimonials from several

    <h2>"THE CUP THAT CHE-(HIC)-ERS!"</h2>

    <p>The Total Abstainer staggered to his feet. The room seemed
    to be waltzing round him, and his legs acted independently of
    each other. One of those legs tried to walk to the right,
    whilst the other moved to the left! He looked in the mirror and
    saw a double reflection! He had two noses, a couple of mouths,
    four eyes, and countless whiskers. This made him merry, and he
    laughed in very glee. But only for a while! Soon he became
    utterly depressed. Then his head ached&mdash;horribly! He tried
    to sleep&mdash;he could not! "Never too late&mdash;to MENDAL!"
    he gasped out, uttering in his extreme agitation the name of a
    Physician of Berlin who had made inebriety a special study.</p>

    <p>Then his muscles became weak and trembling, his aversion to
    labour increased, and he had scarcely the energy or power to
    observe that his complexion (in patches) was ruddier than the
    cherry.</p>

    <p>"Alas!" he sighed, and he succumbed permanently to
    persistent dyspepsia!</p>

    <p>And what was the cause of this unfortunate, this terrible
    condition? Sad to say, the question was easily answered. The
    Total Abstainer had taken a drop too much&mdash;of Coffee!</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>CATCHING;</h2>

    <h3>OR, HOW FAR WILL IT GO?</h3>

    <h4>(<i>Being a Forecast of the spread of the Strike Fever,
    from a Next Week's Diary.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;All the Police, having now been
    replaced by Amateur Special Constables, who are as yet
    unfamiliar with their duties, the position of the Metropolitan
    Magistrates becomes impossible, and they resign in a body at
    five minutes' notice, causing the greatest consternation in
    signalling their resignation by sending every case on the
    charge-sheet that morning for trial to a superior Court.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;The Judges, overwhelmed by the
    prospect of an unusual and quite impossible amount of extra
    work, demand the increase of their salaries to &pound;10,000
    per annum. On this being categorically refused by the Treasury,
    they then and there, on their respective Benches, severally
    tear off their wigs and robes, and quit their Courts "for
    good," with threatening gestures.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;The LORD CHANCELLOR, on being informed
    of the conduct of the Judges, rips open the Woolsack,
    scattering its contents over the floor of the House of Lords,
    and, denouncing the Government, throws up his post on the spot.
    The legal business of the country, coming thus to a deadlock,
    is involved in further chaos by a sudden strike of all the
    Members of both the Senior and Junior Bars, which is further
    complicated by another of every Solicitor in the three
    kingdoms.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Gatling guns being posted in the
    Entrance Hall, and Bow Street having been cleared by a
    preliminary discharge of artillery, the programme of the Royal
    Italian Opera for the evening is carried out, as advertised, at
    Covent Garden. Ladies wearing their diamonds, are conveyed to
    the theatre in Police Vans, surrounded by detachments of the
    Household Cavalry, and gentlemen's evening dress is
    supplemented by a six-chambered revolver, an iron-cased
    umbrella, a head protector, and a double-edged
    cut-and-thrusting broad-sword.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;The Church having caught the prevailing
    fever, the entire body of the Clergy, headed by the Bishops,
    come out on strike, with the result that no morning, afternoon,
    or evening services are held anywhere. The Medical Profession
    takes up the idea, and, discovering a grievance, the Royal
    College of Surgeons issues a manifesto. All the hospitals turn
    out their patients, and medical men universally drop all their
    cases. An M.D. who is known, upon urgent pressure, to have made
    an official visit, is chased up and down Harley Street by a mob
    of his infuriated brother practitioners, and is finally nearly
    lynched on a lamp-post in Cavendish Square. The day closes in
    with a serious riot in Hyde Park, caused by the meeting of the
    conflicting elements of Society, who have all marched there
    with their bands and banners to air their respective
    grievances.</p>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;The London County Council, School
    Board, Common Council, Court of Aldermen, and the Royal
    Academicians after discovering, respectively, some trifling
    sources of dissatisfaction, wreck their several establishments,
    and finally march along the Thames Embankment towards
    Westminster, singing, alternately, the "<i>Marseillaise</i>"
    and "<i>Ask a Pleece-man.</i>"</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The House of Commons, after tossing
    the SPEAKER in his own gown, declare the Constitution extinct,
    and, abolishing the House of Lords and giving all the Foreign
    Ambassadors twelve hours notice to quit the country, announce
    their own dissolution, and immediately commence their Autumn
    Holiday.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Railway Directors, Sweeps, Chairmen
    of Public Companies, Coal-Heavers, Provincial Mayors, Dentists,
    Travelling Circus Proprietors, Fish Contractors, Beadles,
    Cabinet Ministers, Street Scavengers, Dog Fanciers,
    Archbishops, Gas Fitters, Hereditary Legislators, Prize
    Fighters, Poor-Law Guardians, Lion Tamers, Green-Grocers, and
    many other discontented members of the community, having all
    joined in a universal strike, society, becomes totally
    disorganised, and the entire country quietly but, effectually
    collapses, and disappears from the European system.</p>

    <p>Henley Regatta came off as arranged. This is a peculiarity

    We are informed that several certainties were upset, but by

    brutal method as "upsetting" consorts ill with the softer
    manners of our time. On the Thames, too, it must be

    <p>A distinguished Oxford Mathematical Professor has, just

    possible question or controversy:&mdash;That the quantity of
    Almond Rock Hard Bake, consumed in the United Kingdom in the
    year terminating on the 15th of May last, amounted to 17 lbs. 9
    oz. for each member of the population, including women and
    children. That if at all the old and discarded Chimney Pot Hats
    for a like period were collected in a heap, and packed closely
    together, they would fill a building twice the height of St.
    Paul's, and three times the length of the Crystal Palace. That
    winners of the Derby who have become eventually four-wheeler
    cab-horses are ninety-six in number, but that there is <i>only
    one authentic</i> instance of a four-wheeler cab-horse having
    become a Derby winner.</p>

    pass Piccadilly Circus on the outside of the London General
    Omnibus Company's vehicles, between the hours of 8 A.M. and 10

    <h2>THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;<i>Les Huguenots</i>. Great night in
    consequence of police strike in Bow Street. Rioting, and Life
    Guards called out late, just as they were retiring for the
    night. Down they came, in regimentals, in undress, anyhow, to
    quell the disturbance. At least, such is the report inside the
    house. But inconvenient to be in two places at once. Henceforth
    they ought to record this incident by having an extinguisher
    (typical of going to bed and also of quelling the row) slung on
    to their breast-plates. Extinguisher clinking against armour
    would make pretty noise. Their Royal Highnesses the Prince and
    Princess of WALES, having come to enjoy the Opera, remain
    undisturbed, and leave in perfect tranquillity. Excellent
    example to perturbed audience. Excitement within the house.
    DRURIOLANUS, Earl DE GREY, Mr. HIGGINS, and other members of
    the Organising Operatic Committee, ready to charge the mob at a
    moment's notice, to charge up to two guineas a stall, if
    necessary. Not necessary, however. Calls for the Sheriff-elect.
    DRURIOLANUS, not having the official costume ready, cannot
    appear in it, but uses his authority and his persuasive powers
    in clearing lobbies, saloons, and hall. At any moment he is
    ready to march out with all the Huguenot soldiers and charge
    the rioters. Peace restored about midnight, Household troops
    sent home to bed, and constables decided to strike only on the
    heads of roughs, rowdies, and burglars. This shows how useful
    it is to have a Sheriff on the premises. At Her Majesty's last
    winter they had the nearest approach to it, that is, Sheriff's
    officers on the premises. But this is not precisely the same
    thing, as Sheriff's officers wear no uniform, and not being
    permitted to go out of a house when once it is given into their
    custody, they, however valiant, are of no use in a crowd.</p>

    or two. No effect on Opera, which goes as well as ever. Rumours

    <h2>PURELY A MATTER OF BISLEYNESS.</h2>

    <p>PRIVATE R. VAN WINKLE opened his eyes, and, taking up his
    rusty rifle, marched towards the new ranges.</p>

    <p>"Dear me!" said he, gazing with amazement at his
    surroundings, "this is not at all like what I saw when I went
    to sleep."</p>

    <p>"No, RIP, it is not," replied <i>Mr. Punch</i>, who happened
    to be in the neighbourhood. He had been watching his sweetest
    Princess making a bull's-eye at the opening ceremony.</p>

    <p>"Why, it is twice as large as Wimbledon," continued the
    astounded warrior.</p>

    <p>"You are well within the limit," the Sage assented, "and
    see, there is plenty of space. No fear of damaging any of the
    tenants of GEORGE RANGER in <i>this</i> part of the
    country."</p>

    <p>"No, indeed!" exclaimed Private VAN WINKLE. "Not that I
    think His Royal Highness had much cause of complaint. The truth
    is&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Let bygones be bygones," interrupted <i>Mr. Punch</i>.
    "GEORGE RANGER is no longer your landlord, except, in a certain
    sense, representing the interests of the Regular Army, and I
    shall keep <i>my</i> eye upon him in that capacity."</p>

    <p>"An entirely satisfactory arrangement. But where are the
    fancy tents, and the luncheon parties, and all the etceteras
    that used to be so pleasant at Wimbledon?"</p>

    <p>"Disappeared," returned <i>Mr. Punch</i>, firmly. "Bisley is
    to be more like Shoeburyness (where the Artillery set an
    excellent example to the Infantry) than the Surrey
    saturnalia."</p>

    <p>"And is it to be <i>all</i> work and no play?"</p>

    <p>"That will be the general idea. Of course, in the evening,
    when nothing better can be done, there will be harmonic
    meetings round the camp-fires. But while light lasts, the crack
    of the rifle and the ping of the bullet will be heard in all
    directions, <i>vice</i> the pop of champagne corks superseded.
    And if you don't like the prospect, my dear RIP, you had better
    go to sleep again."</p>

    <p>But Private VAN WINKLE remained awake&mdash;to his best
    interests!</p>

    <h2>ROBERT ON MATRIMONY.</h2>

    <p>Well, we're jest about going it, at the reel "Grand Hotel,"
    we are. We had jest about the werry lovliest wedding here,
    larst week, as I ewer seed, ewen with my great xperiense. Such
    a collekshun of brave-looking men and reel handsum women as
    seldom meets together xcept on these most hintresting
    occashuns. And as good luck wood have it, jest as we was in the
    werry wirl and xcitement of it all, who should come in to lunch
    but the same emminent yung Swell as cum about a munth ago. And
    he had jest the same helegant but simple lunch as before, with
    a bottle of the same splendid Champane, as before, and he
    didn't harf finish it, as before, and not a drop of what he
    left was wasted, as before; and so, when he paid me his little
    account, he arsked me if many of the werry bewtifool ladies, as
    I had told him of when he came larst, had been to the "Grand"
    lately, so the bold thort seized, me, and I says to him, "Yes,
    your &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, there's jest a nice few of
    'em here now, and if you will kindly foller me up to our
    bewtifool Libery, and will keep your eyes quite wide open as
    you gos along, you will see jest about a hole room full of
    'em."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/29-2.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>So I took him parst the grand room in which the Wedding
    Gests was assembled, and there sure enuff, he seed such a
    collection of smiling bewty, as ewidently made a great
    impression on his&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;'s Art, and one
    speshally lovely Bridesmade gave him a look, as he passed by,
    as ewidently went rite thro it. I scarcely xpecs to be bleeved
    wen I says, as his &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;'s cheeks quite
    blusht with hadmirashun, and he turned round to me and says,
    says he, "Ah, Mr. ROBERT, if there was many such reel lovely
    angels as that a flying about, I rayther thinks as I shood be
    perswaded to turn a Bennedictus myself." I didn't at all know
    what he meant, but I thort as it was werry credittable to him.
    We got quite a chatting arterwards in the Libery, of course I
    don't mean to say as I forgot for a moment the strornary
    difference atween us, but he had werry ewidently been werry
    much struck by the lovely Bridesmade, for he says, "Mr.
    ROBERT," says he, "what's about the rite time for a man to
    marry?"</p>

    <p>Of course I was reglar staggered, but I pulls myself
    together, and I says, without not no hesitashun, "Jest a leetle
    under 30, your &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;, for the Gent, and
    jest a leetle over 20 for the Lady, and then the Gent gits just
    about 10 years advantage, which I thinks as he's well entitled
    to." At which he larfs quite hartily, and he says, "Why that
    wood keep me single for another ten years&mdash;but I will
    think it over;" and, strange to say, jest as we passed again by
    the room as the Bridal party was in, the same lovely Bridesmade
    happend to be near the door, so they coud both have a good look
    at each other, and a hansum cupple they was, if ever I seed
    one. And when his &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; wished me good
    day, which he did, quite in a frendly way, he added, with his
    most bewtifool smile, "Ten years, MR. ROBERT, seems a long time
    to wait for such a sweet angel as that!"</p>

    <p>Ah, it's a rum world as we all lives in, and in nothink much
    rummer than in the wunderfool power of a bewtifool face, ah,
    and as sumbody says, for Wheel or for Wo, jest as it appens,
    more's the pitty.</p>

    <p>I rayther thinks, as I gathers from the tork of the many
    yung swells as we has dining here, that they are not altogether
    what I shoud call a marrying race; they seems to think as
    there's allers plenty of time for that sollem seremony when
    they're a good deal older.</p>

    <p>Ah, of course it isn't for a poor old Hed Waiter to presume
    to adwise young and hemenent swells, but my xperiense of uman
    life teaches me, as the werry werry appiest time of a man's
    life is from 30 to about 40, perwided as he has been lucky
    enuff to secure for hisself a yung, bewtifool, good-tempered,
    helegant, and ercomplished Bride, to, as the Poet says, harve
    his sorrows, and dubble his joys.</p>

    over there with the mother. She <i>hasn't</i> come, or she'd be
    with them. Poor-looking lot of girls here to-night&mdash;don't
    think much of this music&mdash;get away as soon as I can, no
    <i>go</i> about the thing!... Hooray! There she is, after all!
    Jolly waltz this is they're playing! How pretty she's
    looking&mdash;how pretty <i>all</i> the girls are looking! If I
    can only get her to give me one dance, and sit out most of it
    somewhere! I feel as if I could talk to her to-night. By Jove,
    I'll try it!</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 7.</i>&mdash;Cabinet
    Council on Saturday; House begins to think it's time Ministers
    made up their minds what they're going to do with business of
    Session. But OLD MORALITY returns customary answer. Ministry
    still carefully considering question. Meantime he has nothing
    to say.</p>

    <p>"Except in respect of sex and age, O.M. reminds me." said
    ALBEBT ROLLIT, "of scene in play recently put on stage by
    BEERBOHM TREE&mdash;<i>A Man's Shadow</i> it was called.
    Daresay you remember, TOBY; there's a murder witnessed through
    window by wife and little daughter. They think it's their man
    that did the deed; but 'twas the other fellow&mdash;the Shadow,
    don't you know. There is police inquiry; mother and daughter
    cross-examined; believe the murderer is the husband and father;
    saw him do it with their own eyes; but of course not going to
    peach; little girl pressed to tell all she knows; makes answer
    in voice that thrills Gallery, and makes mothers in the Pit
    weep, 'I have seen nothing, I have heard nothing.' Never see
    OLD MORALITY come to the table, as he is now accustomed nightly
    to do, and protest he has no statement to make, than I think of
    the little TERRY in this Scene, and her wailing, piteous cry,
    'I have seen nothing, I have heard nothing.' Quite time he had,
    though. If Ministers can't make up their minds, what's the
    House to do? Begin to think if things don't mend soon, I shall
    have a better record of business done to show at end of Session
    than the Ministry. Bankruptcy Bill will make three Measures to
    me this Session."</p>

    <p>Irish Constabulary Vote on; Prince ARTHUR lounging on
    Treasury Bench; prepares to receive Irishry; engagement opens a
    little flat, with speech from JOHN ELLIS, oration from
    O'PICTON, and feeble flagellation from FLYNN. Then Prince
    ARTHUR suddenly, unexpectedly, dashes in. Empty benches fill
    up; stagnant pool stirred to profoundest depths: ARTHUR
    professes to be tolerant of Irish Members, but declares himself
    abhorrent of connivance of Right Hon. Gentleman above Gangway.
    Talks at Mr. G., who begins visibly to bristle before our very
    eyes as he sits attentive on Front Bench. ARTHUR in fine
    fighting trim; Ministerial bark may be labouring in troubled
    waters; a suddenly gathered storm, coming from all quarters,
    has surrounded, and threatens to whelm it; MATTHEWS may be
    sinking under adversity; the Postmen may pull down RAIKES;
    GOSCHEN is gone; OLD MORALITY'S cheerful nature is being
    soured; there is talk of Dissolution, and death. But if this is
    Prince ARTHUR'S last time of defending his rule in Ireland, it
    shall not be done in half-hearted way. Come storm, come wrack,
    at least he'll die with harness on his back.</p>

    <p>The accused becomes the accuser. Called upon to defend
    himself, he turns, and makes a slashing attack on his pursuers,
    carrying the war into their camp. Scorning the Captains and
    Men-at-arms, he goes straight for Mr. G., and in an instant
    swords clash across the table, and shields are dinted. Nothing
    more delightful than to hear Mr. G. complaining, as he rose,
    and took his coat off, that Prince ARTHUR had "dragged him into
    the controversy." On the whole, he bore the infliction pretty
    well, and went for ARTHUR neck and crop. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Irish Votes in Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;"I have seen nothing; I have heard
    nothing." Pathetic refrain of OLD MORALITY murmured again
    to-night: Members wanted to know about various things; but in
    OLD MORALITY'S mind, fate of the Tithes Bill, intentions of
    Government touching proposed new Standing Order, and allocation
    of money originally intended for Publicans, all a blank. "We
    are still considering," says he.</p>

    <p>"A most considerate Government," says WILFRID LAWSON. "Might
    save time and trouble if they had at table an automatic
    machine; Members wanting to know how business is to be
    arranged, what Bills to be dropped, and which gone forward
    with, could go up to table, drop a penny in the slot, and out
    would come the answer&mdash;'I have seen nothing; I have heard
    nothing.'"</p>

    <p>Seems that HANBURY has exceptional means of obtaining
    information. OLD MORALITY has privately shown him Military
    Report with respect to Heligoland. A confidential
    communication, something of the kind the MARKISS carried on
    with the population of Heligoland. But HANBURY straightway goes
    and tells all about it in a letter to one of his Constituents;
    letter gets into papers. SUMMERS reads it out to House. Eagerly
    thirsting after knowledge on military matters, SUMMERS wants
    also to see the text of Report. Why should HANBURY have it all
    to himself? Quartermaster-General SUMMERS would like
    opportunity of studying it, and forming opinion as to accuracy
    of the naval and military men who have drawn up plan. Will OLD
    MORALITY favour him by placing him on an equality of confidence
    with HANBURY? No, OLD MORALITY will not. Howl of indignant
    despair from Radicals. Never heard of this Report before; but
    that HANBURY should see it, and thereby be enabled to assure
    his constituents, even by nods and winks, that it was all right
    about Heligoland, was more than they could put up with.
    O'PICTON sat morose at the corner seat below the Gangway. Who
    was HANBURY, that he should have the advantage of studying
    these military documents when the grand-nephew of PICTON of
    Waterloo was left out in the cold, his martial instincts
    unsatisfied, his knowledge of strategical points of the British
    Empire unsatiated?</p>

    <p>Another instance this of the misfortune that pursues the
    Government. Little did OLD MORALITY think, when in moment of
    weakness he showed this important document to HANBURY, what a
    hornet's nest it would bring about his unoffending head.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Irish Constabulary Vote
    passed.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;At last OLD MORALITY has heard
    something and seen something. Heard how things went on to-day
    in Committee on Procedure. Worse and worse. Prince ARTHUR made
    curious blunder for one so alert: introduced into draft Report
    admission of principle that Lords might, an they pleased,
    refuse to consider in current Session, any Bill coming up to
    them from Commons. HARCOURT saw his opportunity; used it with
    irresistible skill and force. Committee adjourned in almost
    comatose state.</p>

    <p>This is what OLD MORALITY has heard from JOKIM, who begins
    to think that, after all, life is a serious thing. What he sees
    is, that it is impossible to further delay decision about
    business. Accordingly announces complete surrender. All, all
    are gone, the old familiar faces&mdash;Land Purchase Bill,
    Tithe Bill, and even this later project of the new Standing
    Order. "What, all our pretty chicks?" cry the agonised
    Ministerialists.</p>

    <p>"Yes," said OLD MORALITY, mingling his tears with theirs,
    "our duty to our QUEEN and Country demands this sacrifice.
    But," he added, bracing up, significantly eyeing Mr. G., and
    speaking in dear solemn tones, "we reserve to ourselves
    absolute freedom of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> action on a future occasion."
       Opposition shouted with laughter, whilst OLD MORALITY stood
       and stared, and wondered what was amusing them now. New
       Session is, according to present intentions, to open in
       November. Will the Land Purchase Bill be taken first? Mr. G.
       wants to know.</p>

    <p>"Sir," said OLD MORALITY, "I have indicated the views of the
    Government as to the Land Purchase Bill, according as those
    views are held at the present time." (Cheers from the
    Ministerialists.) Encouraged by this applause, and, happy
    thought striking him, went on: "But it is impossible for the
    Government to say what circumstances may occur to qualify those
    views."</p>

    <p>Once more Opposition break into storm of laughter; OLD
    MORALITY again regards them with dubious questioning gaze.</p>

    <p>"Curious thing, TOBY," he said to me afterwards, "those
    fellows opposite always laugh when I drop in my most diplomatic
    sentences. It's very well for MACHIAVELLI that he didn't live
    in these times, and lead House of Commons instead of the
    Government of the Florentine Republic. He would never have
    opened his mouth without those Radicals and Irishmen going off
    into a fit of laughter."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Announcement that business
    <i>won't</i> be done.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Still harping on Irish Votes. Want to
    dock Prince ARTHUR'S salary. SWIFT MACNEILL brought down model
    of battering-ram used at Falcarragh; holds it up; shows it in
    working order; Committee much interested; inclined to encourage
    this sort of thing; pleasant interlude in monotony of
    denunciation of Prince ARTHUR and all his works; no knowing
    what developments may not be in store; the other night had
    magic-lantern performance just off Terrace; that all very well
    on fine night; but when it's raining must keep indoors and
    battering-ram suitable for indoor exhibition.</p>

    <p>HAVELOCK wanted to borrow it, says he would like to show
    SCHWANN how it works; but MACNEILL couldn't spare it till Irish
    Votes through.</p>

    <p>New turn given to Debate by plaintive declaration from JOHN
    DILLON that he has "never been shadowed." "A difficult lot to
    deal with," says ARTHUR, gazing curiously at the Shadowless
    Man. "If they are shadowed, they protest; if they're not, they
    repine."</p>

    <p><i>Subaltern</i>. Sorry, Sir, but the men say they know
    their places, and it is useless labour.</p>

    know we have been told to be conciliatory. Open order! March!

    to examine their rifles?</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Certainly. (<i>To Subaltern</i>). Take the rear
    rank, while I look after the front.</p>

    <p><i>Serg.</i> Beg pardon, Sir, but the men haven't taken open
    order yet. They say that they are responsible for their rifles
    when they have to use them before the enemy, and you may rely
    upon it that they will be all right then.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Very well&mdash;then we will dispense with
    inspection of arms. Buttons bright, and straps in their proper
    places?</p>

    <p><i>Serg.</i> (<i>doubtfully</i>). So they say, Sir.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Well, then, read the orders.</p>

    <p><i>Serg.</i> Beg pardon, Sir, but the men say they know
    their duty, and don't want to listen to no orders.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Well, well, I am glad to hear that they are so
    patriotic. Hope that the Commanding Officer will dispense
    (under the circumstances) with the formality. Anything
    more?</p>

    <p><i>Serg.</i> Privates BROWN, JONES, and ROBINSON are told

    <p><i>Capt.</i> March them off, then.</p>

    <p><i>Serg.</i> Please, Sir, they say they want to speak to
    you.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Very well&mdash;bring them up. (Sergeant
    <i>obeys</i>.) Now, men, what is it?</p>

    <p><i>Private Brown</i>. Please, Sir, I have got a

    doctor. I can cure myself.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Very well&mdash;cure yourself. (Private
    <i>salutes, and retires.</i>) And now, JONES and ROBINSON, what
    do you want?</p>

    <p><i>Private Jones</i>. Please, Sir, me and ROBINSON were told
    off for guard six months ago, and we think it's too much to
    expect us to do sentry-go so soon.</p>

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Well, you know your orders.</p>

    <p><i>Private J.</i> Oh, that'll be all right, Sir! We'll

    anything.</p>

    only to give the usual words of command. Company, attention!

    <p><i>Capt.</i> Well, that's to be regretted; although they are
    small enough nowadays, in all conscience! Fire a volley! At a

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.net/license">http://gutenberg.net/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
